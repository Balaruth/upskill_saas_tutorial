Stripe Integration
* Users should have a Stripe customer token (ID) in the users table
* JavaScript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send the card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token. 
* JavaScript should send user fields and card token to our Rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email. plan ID) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer Token and user information to our database.
